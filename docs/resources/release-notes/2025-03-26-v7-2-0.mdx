## Announcements

### New BloodHound Documentation Site is Live\\!

After months of interviewing BloodHound users and community members, we’re pleased to announce our new BloodHound documentation portal -  https://bloodhound.specterops.io/home\\! This new site includes a fresh look and should make finding the content you’re looking for easier. For our extra-dedicated users, this site is once again backed by GitHub. If you see an issue or opportunity in the docs, bring on the pull requests\\!

For our BloodHound Enterprise customers, the support portal and tickets will continue to be hosted at https://support.bloodhoundenterprise.io.

This is just the beginning. We’re developing new resources and guides to help everyone get the most out of our tools\\!

Please let us know if you have any feedback – we’d love to hear it.
